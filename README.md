# Question-and-Answering-Over-Documents-using-LangChain
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We will be using this to chat with our own documents!

## üåü Important points:

#### You will find the Python code under the Models directory 'qna_models.py' within the repository itself. 

#### - Note that inorder to use the LangChain frame work and to implement the QnA finctionality, I've used the OpenAI API Key integration in-order for the interface to perform the necessary tasks.
#### - You can create your own API key using your OPENAI Account accessable thorugh their website.
#### - Add your generated API Key over the text 'ADD-YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY-HERE' in the code.

#### - The Website interface including the design and hosting has been done using Streamlit, which is the initial set of lines present in the code.

#### Also note that this can only be runned on your local device, so make sure that you refer the 'installations.txt' file to install the necessary packages.
#### Make sure you know the location of the directory which contains the files on which you will be performing Question and Answers over. You may refer the 'docs' folder which contains a set of sample text files containing some of the chapters from the book Atomic Habits by James Clear (I love this book by the way, would definitely recommend it). 

#### Finally, you can use the command: streamlit run <file name> to run the code

### The website will automatically pop up on your default browser and you can start interacting with your model!


## ‚úçÔ∏è Note from the Author:
I had developed this code as a part of my Internship project in a MNC. The code that you find here was 100% percent done by me. There have been various versions that were released few weeks after I had finished this. You are welcome to refer those too!

### Have fun! üëã
